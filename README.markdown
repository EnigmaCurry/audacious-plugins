Audacious Plugins
=================

Here's just a few [Audacious](http://audacious-media-player.org/) plugins I've made.

Dynamic filesystem playlist
---------------------------

This tool monitors a given directory for the creation of new audio files and feeds them into your Audacious playlist on the fly.

My use case for this was that I wanted to save a shoutcast stream with streamripper, but at the same time, be able to listen to the same files as they download. I needed a way to queue the new files into the Audacious playlist as they were created, so that the playlist was never exhausted.
